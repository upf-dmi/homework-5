# Exercise 1

You will download a subset of EHR data from the campus global. The data contains only the hospital admission data, patient information and diagnosis data. 

```{r}
library(data.table)
codes <- fread("data/allDiseaseCodes.txt", quote = "")

```


# EDA

Perform an EDA for the data. 
Some guide questions for the EDA are:

What are the most prevalent diseases? Are they different is data is stratified by gender? 
What are the most prevalent diseases when aggregating codes to the level of chapters?
## top diseases in the dataset

### top diseases by gender

# Comorbidities of Obesity

What are the diseases that co-occur with obesity?   
Hint: use the field “Description” in the codes file to retrieve the ICD 9 codes containing the string “obesity”  
```{r}
codes[grepl("obesity", long_title, ignore.case = T)]

```

Alternatively, use the corresponding ICD 9 code. Important note: for these data, the dot of the ICD-9 code has been removed 

## Comorbidities of Obesity stratified by gender

Are the same comorbidities occurring in men and in women ?  


Present the results in a publication-like manner: appropriately use tables and/or different types of plots
Are there any of the comorbidities supported by the literature? Do they have common genetic basis?
